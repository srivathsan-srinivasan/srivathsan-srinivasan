## 👋 Hey, I’m Srivathsan

DevOps Engineer focused on building **reliable, observable, and secure systems at scale**.

I spend most of my time:
- Designing and hardening CI/CD pipelines
- Automating boring, failure-prone workflows
- Improving cloud infrastructure reliability and cost efficiency
- Integrating security and observability into the SDLC (DevSecOps, not buzzword ops)

### What I work with
- **Cloud**: AWS, GCP  
- **Containers**: Docker, Kubernetes  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins  
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana  
- **Languages**: Python, Go, Bash  
- **IaC**: Terraform, Cloud-native tooling

### How I think
- Automate first, document second
- If it’s repetitive, it’s a script
- Reliability > cleverness
- Security and cost are design constraints, not afterthoughts

### Current interests
- Cloud reliability engineering
- Large-scale asset discovery and security tooling
- LLM-assisted automation for infra and ops workflows
- Moving from “DevOps executor” → **platform and reliability ownership**
